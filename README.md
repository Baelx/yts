# A Better Way to Search your Youtube Likes

Searching for something you liked once can be tedious on Youtube's main platform where liked videos are loaded 100 at a time. At the point you bust out your CTRL+F and either find the result, or load 100 more entries.

This simple client-side app will allow you to:
 - Search the entire video liked list at once
 - Search for fields other than title and author
